/// 2. Allow two distinct offers, one offering to buy a
///    given NFToken and the other offering to sell the same
///    NFToken, to be accepted in an atomic fashion. This is
///    called brokered mode.
///
/// To indicate direct mode, use either the nftoken_sell_offer or
/// nftoken_buy_offer fields, but not both. To indicate brokered mode,
/// use both the nftoken_sell_offer and nftoken_buy_offer fields. If you use
/// neither nftoken_sell_offer nor nftoken_buy_offer, the transaction is invalid.
