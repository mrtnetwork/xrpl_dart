/// WebSocket API only! The path_find method searches for a
/// path along which a transaction can possibly be made, and
/// periodically sends updates when the path changes over time.
/// For a simpler version that is supported by JSON-XRPRequest, see the
/// ripple_path_find method. For payments occurring strictly in XRP,
/// it is not necessary to find a path, because XRP can be sent
/// directly to any account.
/// Although the rippled server tries to find the cheapest path or combination
/// of paths for making a payment, it is not guaranteed that the paths returned
/// by this method are, in fact, the best paths. Due to server load,
/// pathfinding may not find the best results. Additionally, you should be
/// careful with the pathfinding results from untrusted servers. A server
/// could be modified to return less-than-optimal paths to earn money for its
/// operators. If you do not have your own server that you can trust with
/// pathfinding, you should compare the results of pathfinding from multiple
/// servers run by different parties, to minimize the risk of a single server
/// returning poor results. (Note: A server returning less-than-optimal
/// results is not necessarily proof of malicious behavior; it could also be
/// a symptom of heavy server load.)
