/// The submit method applies a transaction and sends it to the network to be confirmed
/// and included in future ledgers.
/// This command has two modes:
/// * Submit-only mode takes a signed, serialized transaction as a binary blob, and
/// submits it to the network as-is. Since signed transaction objects are immutable, no
/// part of the transaction can be modified or automatically filled in after submission.
/// * Sign-and-submit mode takes a JSON-formatted Transaction object, completes and
/// signs the transaction in the same manner as the sign method, and then submits the
/// signed transaction. We recommend only using this mode for testing and development.
/// To send a transaction as robustly as possible, you should construct and sign it in
/// advance, persist it somewhere that you can access even after a power outage, then
/// submit it as a tx_blob. After submission, monitor the network with the tx method
/// command to see if the transaction was successfully applied; if a restart or other
/// problem occurs, you can safely re-submit the tx_blob transaction: it won't be
/// applied twice since it has the same sequence number as the old transaction.
/// See [submit](https://xrpl.org/submit.html)
